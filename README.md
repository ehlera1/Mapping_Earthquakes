# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Repository Overview

The purpose of this repository was to demonstrate the the use of GeoJSON data when creating an interactive webpage. The webpage created for this example was that of earthquake data found using the USGS website. While working through this developmeent we used JavaScript, the D3 and Leaflet libraries, as well as Mapbox style to help build a visually appealing and interactive page.
